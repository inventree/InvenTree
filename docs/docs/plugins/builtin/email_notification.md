## Email Notification Plugin

This plugin provides a mechanism to send email notifications to users when certain events occur in InvenTree. It implements the [NotificationMixin](../mixins/notification.md) mixin class, allowing it to send notifications based on events defined in the InvenTree system.

Emails are only sent to users who have a registered email address, and who have enabled email notifications in their user profile.
