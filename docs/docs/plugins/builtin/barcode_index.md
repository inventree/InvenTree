## Barcode Plugins

The **Barcode Plugins** provide barcode support for various suppliers. When receiving items from these suppliers, the barcode on the product can be scanned to automatically identify the product in InvenTree.

These plugins only work with the data in the barcode - there is no integration with the supplier's website or API. The barcode data is used to match against existing products in InvenTree using the settings of the plugin.
