## Attachments

An *attachment* is a file which has been uploaded and linked to a specific object within InvenTree. Attachments can be used to store additional documentation, images, or other relevant files associated with various InvenTree models.

!!! note "Business Logic"
    Attachments are not used for any core business logic within InvenTree. They are intended to provide additional metadata for objects, which can be useful for documentation, reference, or reporting purposes.

Parameters can be associated with various InvenTree models.

### Attachments Tab

Any model which supports attachments will have an "Attachments" tab on its detail page. This tab displays all attachments associated with that object:
