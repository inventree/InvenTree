## Email Settings

InvenTree can be configured to send emails to users, for various purposes.

To enable this, email configuration settings must be supplied to the InvenTree [configuration options](../start/config.md#email-settings).

!!! info "Functionality might be degraded"
    Multiple functions of InvenTree require functioning email delivery, including *Password Reset*, *Notififications*, *Update Infos*

### Outgoing

Mail can be delivered through various ESPs and SMTP. You can only configure one delivery method at a time.

### Incoming

Mail can be received though various ESPs, POP3 and IMAP.

When using POP3/IMAP InvenTree removes email that were processed. This is to prevent duplicate processing of the same email. You can specify a archive folder, that mails should be moved to after processing. This is useful for retaining manual access.

### Supported ESPs

InvenTree uses django-anymail to support various ESPs. A full list of supported ESPs can be found in [their docs](https://anymail.dev/en/stable/esps/).

Most popular providers are supported:

- Amazon SES
- Brevo (EU)
- Postal (Self hosted)
- Mailgun
- Postmark
- SendGrid

### Logging / Admin Insights

Superusers can view the email log in the [Admin Center](./admin.md#admin-center). This is useful for debugging and tracking email delivery / receipt.
