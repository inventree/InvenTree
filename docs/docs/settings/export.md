## Exporting Data

InvenTree provides data export functionality for a variety of data types. Most data tables provide an "Export Data" button, which allows the user to export the data in a variety of formats.

In the top right corner of the table, click the "Export Data" button to export the data in the table.

{% with id="export", url="admin/export.png", description="Export data" %}
