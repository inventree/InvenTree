## Interactive API

If the server is running in [Debug Mode](../start/index.md#debug-mode) then an interactive version of the API is available using a browser.

!!! info "Debug Mode"
    This interactive API is only available when running the server in debug mode

!!! warning "Slow Traffic Ahead"
    The interactive API is *significantly* slower than using the normal JSON format. It is provided only for development and testing.
