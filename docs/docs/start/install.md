title: Install InvenTree
---

## Bare Metal Setup

!!! tip "Installer"
    There is an [installer](./installer.md) available - we recommend using that method.

!!! tip "Docker Guide"
    This guide is for a *bare metal* InvenTree installation. If you want to install using Docker refer to the [Docker Setup Guide](./docker.md)

Follow the instructions below to install the required system packages, python modules, and InvenTree source code.

!!! warning "Experienced Users Only"
    The following instructions assume a reasonably advanced level of system administration knowledge for a linux based OS

### Install System Packages

Install required system packages (as superuser):

!!! warning "OS Specific Requirements"
    The following packages are required on a debian system. A different distribution may require a slightly different set of packages

!!! info "Python Version"
    InvenTree requires a modern Python version [check here]({{ sourcefile("CONTRIBUTING.md") }}) for the current minimums.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install \
    python3 python3-dev python3-pip python3-invoke python3-venv \
    git gcc g++ gettext gnupg \
    poppler-utils libpango-1.0-0 libpangoft2-1.0-0 \
    libjpeg-dev webp
```

!!! warning "Weasyprint"
    On some systems, the dependencies for the `weasyprint` package might not be installed. Consider running through the [weasyprint installation steps](https://doc.courtbouillon.org/weasyprint/stable/first_steps.html) before moving forward.


### Create InvenTree User

!!! warning "Running as Root"
    It is highly recommended that the InvenTree server is not run under root. The deployment instructions assume that InvenTree is installed and run from a different user account.

Create a user account from which we will run the server:

```
sudo useradd -m -d /home/inventree -s /bin/bash inventree
```

InvenTree source code, log files, etc will be located under the `/home/inventree/` directory.

Switch to the `inventree` user so commands are performed in the correct context:

```
sudo su inventree
```

### Create Required Directories

In addition to the location where the InvenTree source code is located, you will need to create some directories for storing data which will be served to the user (and thus must be available to the webserver). The location of these directories must be provided to the server via the [configuration options](./config.md).

#### Static Files

InvenTree requires a directory for storage of [static files](./config.md#static-file-storage).

!!! info "Read More"
    Refer to the [proxy server documentation](./processes.md#proxy-server) for more details

#### Media Files

InvenTree requires a directory for storage of [user uploaded files](./config.md#uploaded-file-storage)

!!! info "Read More"
    Refer to the [proxy server documentation](./processes.md#proxy-server) for more details

#### Backup Directory

Location for storing [database backups](./config.md#backup-file-storage)

### Download Source Code

Download InvenTree source code, into the `./src` directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/inventree/inventree src
```

!!! info "Main Branch = Development"
    The "main" branch of the InvenTree code base represents the "latest" (development) code. If you would like to use most recent "stable" release, target the `stable` branch.

### Create Virtual Environment

Create a python virtual environment for installing required Python packages and binaries:

```
python3 -m venv env
source ./env/bin/activate
```

!!! info "(env) prefix"
    The shell prompt should now display the `(env)` prefix, showing that you are operating within the context of the python virtual environment

### Install InvenTree Packages

The Python packages required by the InvenTree server must be installed into the virtual environment.

```
pip install --upgrade --ignore-installed invoke
invoke install
```

This installs all required Python packages using pip package manager. It also creates a (default) database configuration file which needs to be edited to meet user needs before proceeding (see next step below).

## Create Database

As part of the initial setup, an empty database needs to be created. Follow the instructions below particular to your database engine of choice:

### PostgreSQL

#### Install PostgreSQL

Install required system packages:

!!! info "Sudo Actions"
    Perform sudo actions from a separate shell, as 'inventree' user does not have sudo access

```
sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib libpq-dev
```

And start the postgresql service:

```
sudo service postgresql start
```

#### Create Database and User

We need to create new database, and a postgres user to allow database access.

```
sudo -u postgres psql
```

You should now be in an interactive database shell:

```
create database inventree;
create user myuser with encrypted password 'mypass';
grant all privileges on database inventree to myuser;
```

!!! info "Username / Password"
    You should change the username and password from the values specified above. This username and password will also be for the InvenTree database connection configuration.

#### Install Python Bindings

The PostgreSQL python binding must also be installed (into your virtual environment):

```
pip3 install psycopg pgcli
```

### MySQL / MariaDB

#### Install Backend

To run InvenTree with the MySQL or MariaDB backends, a number of extra packages need to be installed:

!!! info "Sudo Actions"
    Perform sudo actions from a separate shell, as 'inventree' user does not have sudo access

```
sudo apt-get install mysql-server libmysqlclient-dev
```

#### Install Python Bindings

Install the python bindings for MySQL (into the python virtual environment).

```
pip3 install mysqlclient mariadb
```

#### Create Database

Assuming the MySQL server is installed and running, login to the MySQL server as follows:

```
sudo mysql -u root
```

Create a new database as follows:

```
mysql> CREATE DATABASE inventree;
```

Create a new user with complete access to the database:

```
mysql> CREATE USER 'myuser'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'mypass';
mysql> GRANT ALL ON inventree.* TO 'myuser'@'%';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Exit the mysql shell:

```
mysql> EXIT;
```

!!! info "Username / Password"
    You should change the username and password from the values specified above. This username and password will also be for the InvenTree database connection configuration.

## Configure InvenTree Options

Once the required software packages are installed and the database has been created, the InvenTree server options must be configured.

!!! tip "Configuration Options"
    InvenTree configuration can be performed using environment variables, or the `config.yaml` configuration file (or a combination of both).

!!! info "Config Guidelines"
    Refer to the [configuration guidelines](./config.md) for full details.

!!! warning "Configure Database"
    Ensure database settings are correctly configured before proceeding to the next step! In particular, check that the database connection settings match the database you have created in the previous step.

## Initialize Database

The database has been configured above, but is currently empty.

### Schema Migrations

Run the following command to initialize the database with the required tables.

```
cd /home/inventree/src
invoke update
```
NOTE: If you are on Debian, and get "No module named 'django', it might be that `/usr/bin/invoke` are used. Make sure that the python environment (`/home/inventree/env/bin`) is ahead in the PATH variable.

### Create Admin Account

Create a superuser (admin) account for the InvenTree installation:

```
invoke superuser
```

!!! success "Ready to Serve"
    The InvenTree database is now fully configured, and ready to go.

## Start Server

### Development Server

The InvenTree database is now setup and ready to run. A simple development server can be launched from the command line.

The InvenTree development server is useful for testing and configuration - and it may be wholly sufficient for a small-scale installation.

Refer to the [development server instructions](./bare_dev.md) for further information.

### Production Server

In a production environment, a more robust server setup is required.

Refer to the [production server instructions](./bare_prod.md) for further information.

## Updating InvenTree

Administrators wishing to update InvenTree to the latest version should follow the instructions below. The commands listed below should be run from the InvenTree root directory.

!!! info "Update Database"
	It is advisable to [backup the InvenTree database](./backup.md) before performing these steps. The particular backup procedure may depend on your installation details.

### Stop InvenTree Server

Ensure the InvenTree server is stopped. This will depend on the particulars of your database installation.

!!! info "Stop Server"
    The method by which the InvenTree server is stopped depends on your particular installation!

### Update Source Code

Update the InvenTree source code to the latest version (or a particular commit if required).

For example, pull down the latest InvenTree sourcecode using Git:

```
git pull origin master
```

!!! info "Release Versions"
    If you are using a particular version of InvenTree, you may wish to target a specific code branch or tag, instead of just pulling down latest master

### Perform Database Migrations

Updating the database is as simple as calling the `update` script:

```
invoke update
```

!!! info "Skip Backup"
    By default, the `invoke update` command performs a database backup. To skip this step, add the `--skip-backup` flag

This command performs the following steps:

* Ensure all required packages are installed and up to date
* Perform required database schema changes
* Run the user through any steps which require interaction
* Collect any new or updated static files

### Restart Server

Ensure the InvenTree server is restarted. This will depend on the particulars of your database installation.
