## InvenTree App Privacy Policy

The InvenTree mobile app requires some extra permissions for complete functionality. Additionally, some user information is stored locally on the device where the app is installed.

## Data Collection

### User Profiles

The InvenTree app requires the user to enter profile data to connect with an InvenTree server:

- Server address
- Account username
- Account password

Profile data is stored locally on the device, and can be deleted by the user if they wish. Profile data is only used for connection with an InvenTree server.

### Camera Permissions

The InvenTree app requires permission to access the device camera for the following purposes:

- Scanning barcode data
- Taking pictures with the device camera for upload to connected InvenTree server

Pictures taken in the InvenTree app are not stored or distributed to any other services.

## Personal Information

The InvenTree app does not collect any information which could be used to personally identify the user(s) of the device onto which the app is installed.

## Third Party Access

The InvenTree app does not share any personal information on users of the app with any third parties.

## Error Logs

The InvenTree app makes use of the [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/) service to monitor the app for bugs and run-time errors. When an error occurs in the app, log data is uploaded to the sentry server, where InvenTree developers can use this information to improve the quality of the app.

!!! question "Identifying Information"
    The uploaded error reports contain information on the nature of the error / bug; i.e. "where" in the app code the failures occurred. The uploaded data does not contain any information which can be used to identify users or extract user data.

!!! tip "Disable Error Reporting"
    If desired, users can disable error reporting entirely, from within the [app settings](./settings.md). This prevents any error logs from being uploaded to the sentry server.
