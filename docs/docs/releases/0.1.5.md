[Release 0.1.5](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/releases/tag/0.1.5) (January 2021) provides a number of major new features and improvements, as well as some crucial bug fixes:

## New Features

### Target Date for Build Order

[#1168](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/1168) introduces the concept of *Target Date* for a Build Order. This is the intended completion date for the build. If the date is reached but the build is not yet complete, the build is consider *overdue*.

Refer to the [build documentation](../build/build.md#overdue-builds) for more information.

### Target Date for Sales Order

[#1177](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/1177) introduces the concept of *Target Date* for a Sales Order. This is the intended shipment date for the order. If the date is reached but the order is not yet complete, the order is considered *overdue*.

### Target Date for Purchase Order

[#1232](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/1232) introduces the concept *Target Date* for a Purchase Order. This is the expected delivery date for the order. If the date is reached but the order is not yet complete, the order is considered *overdue*.

### Stock Item Expiry

[#1202](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/1202) introduces the concept of an *Expiry Date* for Stock Items. For further information, refer to the [expiry documentation](../../stock/expiry).

### Stock Ownership

[#1155](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/1155) adds ownership to stock locations and items. Ownership allows control over which user group or individual user can edit and manage specific stock locations and items.

### Improved Label Printing

[#1212](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/1212) significantly improves the existing label printing functionality. Documentation for the new label printing system [can be found here](../report/labels.md).

### Improved Report Printing

### Improved Permission System
