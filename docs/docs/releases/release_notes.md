## InvenTree Versioning

The InvenTree project follows a formalized release numbering scheme, according to the [semantic versioning specification](https://semver.org/).

### Stable Branch

The head of the *stable* code branch represents the most recent stable tagged release of InvenTree.

    To pull down the latest *stable* release of InvenTree in docker, use `inventree/inventree:stable`

### Development Branch

The head of the *master* code branch represents the "latest and greatest" working codebase. All features and bug fixes are merged into the master branch, in addition to relevant stable release branches.
