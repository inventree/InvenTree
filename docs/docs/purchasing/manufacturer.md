### Add Manufacturer

Once the manufacturer page is loaded, click on the <span class="badge inventree add">{{ icon("plus-circle") }} New Manufacturer</span> button: the "Create new Manufacturer" form opens. Fill-in the manufacturer information (`Company name` and `Company description` are required) then click on <span class="badge inventree confirm">Submit</span>

!!! info "Manufacturer vs Supplier"
    In the case the manufacturer sells directly to customers, you may want to enable the checkbox `is supplier` before submitting the form (you can also enable it later on). Purchase orders rely exclusively on [supplier parts](./supplier.md#supplier-parts), therefore the manufacturer will need to be set as a supplier too.


### Manufacturer Parts

Manufacturer parts are linked to a manufacturer and defined as manufacturable items.
