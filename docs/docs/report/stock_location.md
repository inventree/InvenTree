## Stock location Reports

You can print a formatted report of a stock location. This makes sense if you have several parts inside one location, e.g. a box that is sent out to a manufacturing partner. Whit a report you can create a box content list.

### Context Variables
You can use all content variables from the [StockLocation](./context_variables.md#stocklocation) object.

### Default Report Template

A default report template is provided out of the box, which can be used as a starting point for developing custom return order report templates.

View the [source code](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/blob/master/InvenTree/report/templates/report/inventree_slr_report.html) for the default stock location report template.
