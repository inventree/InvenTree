## Companies

External companies are represented by the *Company* database model. Each company may be classified into the following categories:

- [Customer](#customers)
- [Supplier](#suppliers)
- [Manufacturer](#manufacturers)

!!! tip Multi Purpose
    A company may be allocated to multiple categories, for example, a company may be both a supplier and a customer.

### Edit Company

To edit a company, click on the <span class='fas fa-edit'>Edit Company</span> icon in the actions menu. Edit the company information, and then click on <span class='badge inventree confirm'>Submit</span>.

!!! warning "Permission Required"
    The edit button will not be available to users who do not have the required permissions to edit the company

### Disable Company

Rather than deleting a company, it is possible to disable it. This will prevent the company from being used in new orders, but will not remove it from the database. Additionally, any existing orders associated with the company (and other linked items such as supplier parts, for a supplier) will remain intact. Unless the company is re-enabled, it will not be available for selection in new orders.

It is recommended to disable a company rather than deleting it, as this will preserve the integrity of historical data.

To disable a company, simply edit the company details and set the `active` attribute to `False`:

{% with id="company_disable", url="order/company_disable.png", description="Disable Company" %}
{% include "img.html" %}
{% endwith %}

To re-enable a company, simply follow the same process and set the `active` attribute to `True`.

### Delete Company

To delete a company, click on the <span class='fas fa-trash-alt'></span> icon under the actions menu. Confirm the deletion using the checkbox then click on <span class="badge inventree confirm">Submit</span>

!!! warning "Permission Required"
    The edit button will not be available to users who do not have the required permissions to delete the company

!!! danger "Take Care"
    Deleting a company instance will also remove any orders or supplied parts associated with that company!

### Contacts

Each company can have multiple assigned *Contacts*. A contact identifies an individual who is associated with the company, including information such as name, email address, phone number, etc.

The list of contacts associated with a particular company is available in the <span class='badge inventree nav main'><span class='fas fa-users'></span> Contacts</span> navigation tab:

{% with id="contact_list", url="order/contact_list.png", description="Contact List" %}
{% include "img.html" %}
{% endwith %}


A *contact* can be assigned to orders, (such as [purchase orders](./purchase_order.md) or [sales orders](./sales_order.md)).

### Addresses

A company can have multiple registered addresses for use with all types of orders.
An address is broken down to internationally recognised elements that are designed to allow for formatting an address according to user needs.
Addresses are composed differently across the world, and InvenTree reflects this by splitting addresses into components:
- Line 1: Main street address
- Line 2: Extra street address line
- Postal Code: Also known as ZIP code, this is normally a number 3-5 digits in length
- City: The city/region tied to the postal code
- Province: The larger region the address is located in. Also known as State in the US
- Country: Country the address is located in, written in CAPS

Here are a couple of examples of how the address structure differs by country, but these components can construct a correctly formatted address for any given country.

UK address format:
Recipient
Line 1
Line 2
City
Postal Code
Country

US Address Format:
Recipient
Line 1
Line 2
City State Postal Code
Country


Addresses can be accessed by the <span class='badge inventree nav main'><span class='fas fa-map-marked'></span> Addresses</span> navigation tab.

#### Primary Address

Each company can have exactly one (1) primary address.
This address is the default shown on the company profile, and the one that is automatically suggested when creating an order.
Marking a new address as primary will remove the mark from the old primary address.

## Customers

A *customer* is an external client to whom parts or services are sold.

To access the customer page, click on the <span class="badge inventree nav main"><span class='fas fa-truck'></span> Sell</span> navigation tab and click on <span class="badge inventree nav main"><span class='fas fa-user-tie'></span> Customers</span> option in the dropdown list.

!!! warning
	**Viewing**, **adding**, **editing** and **deleting** customers require the corresponding [Sales Orders user permissions](../settings/permissions.md)

### Add Customer

Once the customer page is loaded, click on the <span class="badge inventree add"><span class='fas fa-plus-circle'></span> New Customer</span> button: the "Create new Customer" form opens. Fill-in the manufacturer information (`Company name` and `Company description` are required) then click on <span class="badge inventree confirm">Submit</span>

## Manufacturers

A manufacturer is an external **producer** of parts and raw materials.

!!! info
	**Viewing**, **adding**, **editing** and **deleting** manufacturers require the corresponding [Purchase Orders user permissions](../settings/permissions.md)

To access the list of manufacturers , click on the <span class="badge inventree nav main"><span class='fas fa-shopping-cart'></span> Buy</span> navigation tab and click on <span class="badge inventree nav main"><span class='fas fa-industry'></span> Manufacturers</span> option in the dropdown list.

!!! info "Manufacturer vs Supplier"
	In the case the manufacturer sells directly to customers, you may want to enable the checkbox `is supplier` before submitting the form (you can also enable it later on). Purchase orders rely exclusively on [supplier parts](#supplier-parts), therefore the manufacturer will need to be set as a supplier too.

By disabling the part in the InvenTree system, it will no longer be available for selection in new purchase orders. However, any existing purchase orders which reference the supplier part will remain intact.

The "active" status of a supplier part is clearly visible within the user interface:

{% with id="supplier_part_disable", url="order/disable_supplier_part.png", description="Disable Supplier Part" %}
{% include "img.html" %}
{% endwith %}

To change the "active" status of a supplier part, simply edit the supplier part details and set the `active` attribute:

{% with id="supplier_part_disable_edit", url="order/disable_supplier_part_edit.png", description="Disable Supplier Part" %}
{% include "img.html" %}

#### Supplier Part Availability

InvenTree supports tracking 'availability' information for supplier parts. While this information can be updated manually, it is more useful when used in conjunction with the InvenTree plugin system.

A custom can periodically request availability information (via a supplier API), and update this availability information for each supplier part.

If provided, availability information is displayed on the Supplier Part detail page.

{% with id="supplier_part_availability", url="order/supplier_part_availability.png", maxheight="240px", description="Supplier part availability" %}
{% include "img.html" %}
{% endwith %}

Availability information can be manually updated via the user interface:

{% with id="update_availability", url="order/update_availability.png", maxheight="240px", description="Update availability" %}
{% include "img.html" %}
{% endwith %}
