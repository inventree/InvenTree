# Docker compose recipe for InvenTree
# - Runs PostgreSQL as the database backend
# - Runs Gunicorn as the InvenTree web server
# - Runs the InvenTree background worker process
# - Runs nginx as a reverse proxy

# ---------------------------------
# IMPORTANT - READ BEFORE STARTING!
# ---------------------------------
# Before running, ensure that you change the "/path/to/data" directory,
# specified in the "volumes" section at the end of this file.
# This path determines where the InvenTree data will be stored!
#
