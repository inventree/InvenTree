# Docker compose recipe for InvenTree development server
# - Runs sqlite database
# - Uses built-in django webserver
# - Runs the InvenTree background worker process
# - Serves media and static content directly from Django webserver

# IMPORTANT NOTE:
# The InvenTree docker image does not clone source code from git.
# Instead, you must specify *where* the source code is located,
# (on your local machine).
# The django server will auto-detect any code changes and reload the server.
