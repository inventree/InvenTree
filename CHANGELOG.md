## [Unreleased - 1.0.0 ] - 2025-07-xx

The first "stable" release following semver but not extensively other than the previous releases. The use of 1.0 indicates the stability that users already expect from InvenTree.

An overarching theme of this release is the complete switch to a new UI framework and paradigm (PUI). The old templating based UI (CUI) is now removed. This makes major improvements in the security and portability of InvenTree possible.

Our blog holds [a few articles](https://inventree.org/blog/2024/09/23/ui-roadmap) on the topic. This journey started in [March 2022](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/issues/2789) and was announced [in 2023](https://inventree.org/blog/2023/08/28/react).
