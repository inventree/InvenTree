# Docker compose recipe for a production-ready InvenTree setup, with the following containers:
# - PostgreSQL as the database backend
# - gunicorn as the InvenTree web server
# - django-q as the InvenTree background worker process
# - Caddy as a reverse proxy
# - redis as the cache manager (optional, disabled by default)

# ---------------------
# READ BEFORE STARTING!
# ---------------------

# -----------------------------
# Setting environment variables
# -----------------------------
# Shared environment variables should be stored in the .env file
# Changes made to this file are reflected across all containers!
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE:
# You should not have to change *anything* within this docker-compose.yml file!
# Instead, make any changes in the .env file!

# ------------------------
# InvenTree Image Versions
# ------------------------
# By default, this docker-compose script targets the STABLE version of InvenTree,
# image: inventree/inventree:stable
#
# To run the LATEST (development) version of InvenTree,
# change the INVENTREE_TAG variable (in the .env file) to "latest"
#
# Alternatively, you could target a specific tagged release version with (for example):
# INVENTREE_TAG=0.7.5
#

# ----------------------------
# Docker compose customization
# ----------------------------
# If you wish to customize the docker-compose script, you should only do so if you understand the stack!
# Do not expect support for customizations that are not part of the standard InvenTree setup!
